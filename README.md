# age_gender_recognition
This project implements a real-time age and gender detection system using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for deep learning functionalities. The system can detect faces in real-time video streams and estimate the age and gender of the detected faces.
